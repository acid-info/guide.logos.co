# Brand guidelines

The Logos Brand Guidelines are a comprehensive set of guidelines that serve as the foundation for Logos' visual identity. As a grassroots movement committed to providing trust-minimized, corruption-resistant governing services and social institutions to underserved citizens, Logos is rooted in a set of core values and principles that guide its overall branding strategy.

At the heart of the Logos Branding Language Guidelines is a modular approach to branding that allows for a flexible and adaptable approach. By breaking down the guidelines into smaller components, it becomes easier to build and maintain a cohesive brand identity that can evolve with the brand. This modularity ensures that all Logos sub-brands share the same DNA and core values while allowing for customization to meet the unique needs of each sub-brand.
