# Overview

## Logos System Design (LSD)

LSD is a rebellious open-source design system for products and digital experiences that defy the norm. Based on the [Philosophy](../../Philosophy%20e9f9330417fa4c4db19b32f3ad9c0e14.md) & [Visual Language](../../Brand%20Guidelines%200d3e1a6b893f49e4af154fae0efa585a/Visual%20Language%20ba5c311d09c74fc4bc97ad0d4ed545ac.md) , we're tearing down the established order by removing unnecessary visual design layers and logic. Our core principle, "The message is the message," is a call to arms against the homogenized and trendy design that's suffocating the industry. We're giving the power back to the people by decentralizing design and placing more value on the content and message. This minimalistic and functional approach is a middle finger to the status quo.

We're fed up with the bloated and superficial web design world and its endless parade of visual pollution. That's why we're taking a stand and focusing on what really matters: the message. LSD aims to reduce visual elements in its implementation, resulting in a radical approach that challenges the hype and noise in the current web design world (2.0 or 3.0). We want to take design back to its roots and make it accessible to everyone. LSD is about the message and nothing else. With working code, design tools and resources, human interface guidelines, and a community of fellow dissidents, LSD leads the charge against the establishment.

## Theming

LSD offers two unique themes, each with its approach to design.

### Radical Theme

The "Radical Theme" is a unified minimal style that brings a sense of radicalism and anarchism to your design. This theme emphasizes minimalistic and unified design that challenges the status quo and empowers the user to think outside the box.

### Anarcho-Default theme (not available)

The "Anarcho-Default" theme is an even more radical approach to design. It eliminates the need for extra data and downloads by adopting the native built-in design for each component and element. This theme is a true expression of the message being the message, as it works in any environment without the need for additional design elements.
