# Grid and Layout

At the core of our design philosophy is the belief that good design is functional and accessible. To achieve this, we rely on a grid system that provides a consistent and reliable foundation for all of our designs. Our grid system is not only a tool for organizing content and creating layouts, but also a reflection of our values and principles.
