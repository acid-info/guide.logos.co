# Typography

Typography is a fundamental element in our design philosophy, where the message takes precedence over fonts. We prioritise accessibility, simplicity, and functionality, relying on default typefaces across various operating systems and devices for consistency. 

Our inspiration from underground culture and the DIY ethos shapes a brand that is accessible and reproducible by all, regardless of tools or location. Our approach emphasises readability, addressing contrast, tracking, leading, and dynamic text for all users, including those with visual impairments. Typeface selection aligns with these principles, prioritising accessibility, simplicity, and functionality through default system fonts, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and maintaining a neutral and dependable brand presentation. 

Typography, in our view, is the art of balancing typeface, size, style, and spacing to optimise readability, reflecting our dedication to content accessibility and a consistent, reliable message.
