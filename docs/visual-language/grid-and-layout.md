# Grid & Layout

## **Grid System**

At the core of our design philosophy is the belief that good design is functional and accessible. To achieve this, we rely on a grid system that provides a consistent and reliable foundation for all of our designs. Our grid system is not only a tool for organizing content and creating layouts, but also a reflection of our values and principles.

### **Modularity**

Our grid system is modular, meaning it can be scaled and adapted to fit any medium or device. The grid is made up of equal-width columns, with gutters in between. The size of the columns and gutters are based on a 12-point scale, with a minimum width of 16px for gutters. This modularity ensures that our designs are flexible and adaptable, while also maintaining consistency and structure.

### **Flexibility**

Flexibility is essential in today's constantly evolving design landscape. Our grid system allows for a wide range of possibilities, from complex, multi-column layouts to simple, single-column designs. This flexibility also enables designers to experiment and push boundaries, while still maintaining a consistent structure and aesthetic.

### **Accessibility**

Accessibility is a fundamental part of our design philosophy, and our grid system reflects this. By providing a consistent structure and hierarchy, our grid system makes it easier for users to navigate and understand our designs. It also ensures that our designs are accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of their technical expertise or physical abilities.

### **Inspiration**

Our grid system is inspired by the works of Kimberly Elam and other pioneers of grid-based design. However, we have adapted and customized this system to fit our own needs and values. We encourage designers to experiment with our grid system, and to find their own ways of using it to create beautiful, functional designs.

In summary, our grid system is a fundamental part of our design philosophy, reflecting our values of modularity, flexibility, accessibility, and experimentation. By using this system as a foundation, we create designs that are not only beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, but also functional and accessible to all.
