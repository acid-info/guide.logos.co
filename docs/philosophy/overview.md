# Overview

We see design as a form of activism that has the potential to inspire change, promote justice, and resist inhuman ideologies. To us, design goes beyond aesthetics; it's about connecting people to ideas in significant ways. Our design philosophy is grounded in creating meaningful and broad-reaching design solutions.

Central to our approach is the belief that “the message is the message.” We prioritize the message over its medium, giving it precedence over the platform it's on or the form it takes. In parallel, we strive to deliver designs that are functional and utilitarian, not trendy or fashionable, because creating meaning, purpose, and impact is what we value most.

We also believe that in design modularity and scalability foster collaboration and diversity. We prioritize solutions that are accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of their technical expertise, physical abilities, or other circumstances.
