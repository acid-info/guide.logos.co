# Principles

On this page, we'll outline our design principles and how they shape the co-branding system for Logos and its subdivisions.

Our design philosophy is built on the notion that messages often get muddled in excessive presentation. We counter this by focusing on clear, utility-based designs that emphasize content over form; thus substance over spectacle.

### Core Principles

**Activist**: We use design to challenge inhuman ideologies, promoting social and political activism. We emphasize community, cooperation, privacy, and censorship resistance..

**Permissive**: We champion a collaborative approach, moving away from singular design authorities. Our emphasis is on enabling everyone to participate in the creative process without being anchored to specific design styles.

**Material Focus**: We create tangible digital objects, not images. For us, a website is straightforward â€” texts and data presented clearly.

**Inclusion**: We emphasize transparency, ensuring our designs are inclusive and accessible. This includes compatibility across various internet conditions and devices. In essence, our approach prioritizes function, inclusivity, and resistance to dominant designs and ideologies.
