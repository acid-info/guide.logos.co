# Principles

In this page, we'll discuss the core principles of our design and communication philosophy, and how they inform our approach to creating a modular co-branding system for Logos and its business units.

Our design philosophy is born out of a resistance to the erosion of collective thinking and the domination of representations and projections in modern society. We believe that the spectacle, while beautiful, blocks our access to reality and leads to cultural degeneration. Proprietary design systems often turn messages into murky representations of ideologies and thoughts that lack transformative power.

To counteract this, our design system centers the mind and collective thinking. We aim to unlearn the gift-wrapping of content and enable a design system that is agnostic to technology, form, and containers. Our design system is utilitarian, enabling instead of decorating, and we emphasize that the message is the message, not the medium.

****Design as ideology****

We believe in designing solutions that resist dominant ideologies and promote social and political activism. Our design philosophy is communal, cooperative, and owned equally by all. Praxis, a symbiosis of theory and practice, is at the core of our design philosophy. Our solutions are designed to be censorship-resistant and protect the privacy of users.

****Design as Activism****

We believe that design is a form of activism. Our design systems insists that designs are objects, resisting the pull of the spectacle by stressing their material quality. We use design to cause change to occur in conformity with our will. By focusing on the idea of design as matter, we go against alienation and create designs that enable rather than decorate.

****Design as Archivism****

Our design philosophy uses social-democratic language and memories of the welfare state system to create a subjective archive of social-democratic aesthetics. This archivism is our way of standing against the tide of populist and neoliberal ideologies. We believe that re-materializing design is a way to enable the "makeability" of society, which is the social-democratic concept of changing society through changing material circumstances. Our design system outlines the way out of alienation and enables the liberation of our senses through the de-alienating power of aesthetics.

****Design as Object****

Our design system creates objects, not images. We show materiality through self-referentiality, stressing that a website is "just" a collection of pieces of text and information, a sheet of digital paper with some digital ink on it.

****Design without the designer****

We believe that design should not stand in the way of the message, and that it should not emerge from one central point of authority (the designer). Our design system is decentralized and uses accessible language to enable everyone to have access to and ownership of the creative process. We avoid terms like function-driven and content-driven, encouraging communication between living and thinking human beings. Everyone has the power to decide not only what they read, but how they read, gaining independence from dominant information channels and establishing their own. We aim to create solutions that are functional and serve a specific purpose, rather than being tied to a particular designer or design style. 

Anonymous Design defines design that is created to fulfill a functional need, such as solving a problem, rather than being tied to a specific designer. By using accessible language and avoiding jargon, we aim to make the design system more inclusive and to promote a more democratic approach to design that values privacy.

****Openness and Accessibility****

We believe in being transparent and open about our design choices and processes. Our solutions are designed to be accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of their technical expertise, physical abilities, or other circumstances. This includes providing solutions that are compatible with a range of internet speeds and devices. We aim to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and is not excluded based on any aspect of their identity or situation. Our solutions prioritize accessibility, while also protecting the privacy of users and enabling free expression.
